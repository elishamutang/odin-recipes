            Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This recipe can be used to also make
            tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu
            sauce.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves pounded to 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour,
                beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts
                in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs
                until well coated on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil,
                and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel
                lined plate to drain.
            </li>
        </ol>

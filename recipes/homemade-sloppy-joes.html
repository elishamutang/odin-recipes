        <h2><em>Homemade Sloppy Joes don't have to be difficult to eat. Despite the name of this
            iconic retro dish, the secret to a great Sloppy Joe is a thick, rich, almost dry
            consistency, which allows the sandwich to be eaten with your hands. Serve on
            hamburger buns.</em>
        </h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups water, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 dash Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook
                and stir until beef is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in green pepper and garlic; cook and stir until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
                Add 1 cup water and stir, scraping the pan to dissolve any brown flavor bits from
                the bottom of the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, salt, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.
                Add remaining 1 cup water and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and shimmer,
                stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and mixture is thick, about 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>

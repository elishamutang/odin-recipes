# First project from The Odin Project

This project is for the Foundations Course on The Odin Project, which focuses on creating a 'Recipe' website using HTML!

## Things I learnt:
- Using VSCode and utilizing the HTML boilerplate shortcut by typing '!'.
- Linking images to my website using links from other online websites.
- Create ordered and unordered lists and styling sentences using bold or italic.
- Linking webpages to home website.

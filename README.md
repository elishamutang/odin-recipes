- Linking images to my website using links from other online websites.
- Create ordered and unordered lists and styling sentences using bold or italic.
- Linking webpages to home website.
- Styling webpages using CSS.
- Difference between Block and Inline elements and how they affect the layout of a page.
- Box model (standard box model and alternative box model).
- Positioning of elements.
